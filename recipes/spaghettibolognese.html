    <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
    <img src="../images/spaghetti_bolognese.jpg">
    <p>My everyday Bolognese recipe I make over and over again. This Meat Sauce has terrific depth of flavour for such a quick recipe â€“ though if you have the time, it's stellar cooked slowly for a couple of hours. My 3 "secret" tips are: Worcestershire Sauce, Beef Bouillon Cubes and a touch of sugar. </p>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>13 oz</strong> dried spaghetti</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 tablespoons</strong> olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> onion</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> garlic cloves</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> dried red wine</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> beef buillon cubes</li>
        <li><strong>1 28 oz can</strong> crushed tomato</li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> tomato paste</li>
        <li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong> white sugar</li>
        <li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong> worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> dried bay leaves</li>
        <li><strong>2 sprigs</strong> fresh thyme</li>
        <li>parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned. </li>
        <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 - 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally. </li>
        <li><strong>Slow simmer option:</strong> really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 - 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti - though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta.</li>
    </ol>
